# EvoAlgo
Evolutionary Algorithm as a replacement to neural networks

- genetic programming
- male and female 
- variability hypothesis
- make the reward function binary that your genetic line survives the agent
    - hidden markov process
- programmed death function
- the food function is the minimization of the loss function
- have a way for them to compete against each other
- and a way to join together
- female vulnerable during pregnancy
- child vulnerable
- male lots of responsibility
- eventually the agents will die out
- have disease in the system when population too high
- geometric algebra, sympletic derivatives
- random matrix theory
- yuval harari books
- modeling the pde
